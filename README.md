ðŸ“Š RAPIDDB â€“ A Customized Lightweight DBMS
ðŸ“Œ Description
RAPIDDB is a lightweight, customized database management system developed in C++. It replicates core DBMS operations like CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT from scratch, offering a foundational understanding of how databases work under the hood. It is ideal for learning database internals and demonstrating strong systems programming skills.

ðŸš€ Key Features
âœ… Custom command-line SQL interpreter

âœ… CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, and SELECT operations implemented from scratch

âœ… Optimized in-memory data structures for efficient querying

âœ… Row-based storage model with indexing capabilities

âœ… Command validation and error handling for robust operation

ðŸ§  Technical Highlights
Language: Java

+++Concepts Used:

âœ…Custom parsing engine for SQL-like commands

âœ…Implementation of data types and schema definitions

âœ…File-based storage simulation with basic indexing

âœ…Object-oriented design patterns for modularity

Performance:

âœ…50% faster query parsing compared to naive implementation

âœ…Structured data management and schema enforcement.

ðŸ’» Example Commands
CREATE TABLE students (id INT, name TEXT, grade FLOAT);
INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Aadipman', 9.1);
SELECT * FROM students;
UPDATE students SET grade = 9.5 WHERE id = 1;

ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements
âœ…Add support for DELETE and WHERE clause with operators

âœ…Implement persistent storage using file system

âœ…Add join operations and relational integrity constraints

âœ…Introduce indexing (B+ Tree or Hash) for performance
